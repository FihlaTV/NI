Possible institutional digital order - make them an Institution?
================================================================

<%= @greeting %> Admins,
It looks like this order was from an institution.
So have a look and make them an institution if they
seem legitimate:
<%= admin_user_url(@user, :protocol => "https") %>

Cheers, the NI team.
