New Internationalist Magazine - digital subscription
====================================================

<%= @greeting %> <%= @user.username %>,
You've now been made an Institutional user.
This means you have the power to create 'student' user
accounts which will share your subscription.

Feel free to create a couple of them, perhaps one for
staff and one for students.

To do this, click the green button in the right hand
corner of the screen that displays your username, and 
then on your user-page click the button that says 
'Create a new student account':
<%= user_url(@user) %>

Now you can share the username and password of the
student account you created with the school.

Great, now you can start reading!
<%= issues_url %>

For future reference, your username is: <%= @user.username %>

<% if @user.subscriber? and @user.is_recurring? %>
Your next auto-debit will be on:
<% elsif @user.subscriber? %>
Your subscription is due for renewal:
<% end %>
<% if @user.subscriber? %>
<%= @user.last_subscription.expiry_date.strftime("%e %B, %Y") %>

<% end %>
If you come across any problems, simply hit 'reply' to this
email and we'll reply as soon as we can.

NOTE: please don't share your main account with
anyone, as they can then edit your details.

Cheers, the NI team.
