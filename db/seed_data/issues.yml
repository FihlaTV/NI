    editors_letter: ! "As an undergraduate, I took psychology for two years. People
      who study the subject tend to be drawn to it because they are seeking to solve
      puzzles in their own mental makeup. I was no exception.\r\n\r\nBut I was also
      seeking another connection and answers to the question: what is my place in
      the world? That led to an informal dalliance with philosophy as well. \r\n\r\nI
      didn’t know it then, but the answers aren’t readymade, and I am still working
      them out.  \r\n\r\nAn answer I find particularly important is: in order to find
      my place in the world, I need to be of it. However much I love solitude, disconnection
      is a dead end. \r\n\r\nThis has been painfully brought home on the many occasions
      I have had to visit locked psychiatric wards. Whatever their faults – tedium
      seems more common now than the horrors recounted by survivors just a couple
      of decades ago – they can be places where some people in extreme mental distress
      find the time and space to make peace with themselves. Society at large seldom
      offers such a space. \r\n\r\nThe challenge of mental ill health is often seen
      only as an individual challenge; the social challenge to build inclusive, supportive
      communities is barely considered, perhaps because it appears too great a task.
      Or perhaps because it is too much like common sense. \r\n\r\nSince this edition
      was announced last month, readers have been writing in, wishing to contribute
      on this theme. Sadly, we were fully commissioned by then, but as ever we want
      to know what you think. So do email or write to us."

    editors_letter: ! "The United Nations says the global earth summit it is holding
      in Rio this month ‘is a chance to move away from business as usual and to act
      to end poverty, address environmental destruction and build a bridge to the
      future’.\r\n\r\nSplendid aims. However, a great many of those involved in shaping
      the outcome are from the fossil-fuel, mining, banking and carbon-trading sectors.\r\n\r\nSo
      we reckon a reality check is in order. This month’s issue gives you the ‘unofficial
      guide’ to Rio+20, as the summit is called. Writer and activist Danny Chivers
      also removes the fig-leaves from a selection of corporate miscreants in his
      exposé of ‘Eight Great Greenwashers’. Some on the list are household names;
      others may be new to you.\r\n\r\nAlso this month, Richard Swift answers the
      tricky question of why the political Right gained and the Left lost ground in
      the wake of the financial crisis. This essay won him the prestigious US Daniel
      Singer Millennium Prize. Time will tell if the tide can really be turned, in
      Europe at any rate, following the French and Greek elections.\r\n\r\nElsewhere,
      intrepid filmmaker Nadia El Fani explains why she had to leave her native Tunisia.
      Outspoken US scholar Norman Finkelstein posits that Jewish Americans are falling
      out of love with Israel – and discusses what that could mean for peace in the
      Middle East. Charismatic Indian activist Bunker Roy talks about ‘granny power’,
      and British comedian Jeremy Hardy reflects on being a Marxist at the tender
      age of 10."

    editors_letter: ! "Lurching through the streets of <i>Dhaka</i> on a narrow rickshaw
      seat, I thought I would be catapulted out at any time.\r\n\r\nThen I peered
      through the dust around me. I saw all sorts of precious cargo balanced on passengers’
      knees: sleeping infants, panes of glass, towers of egg boxes.\r\n\r\nThe driver
      understood his environment well, I realized, and could navigate the many hazards
      on the roads.\r\n\r\nA nail-biting journey by rickshaw struck me as an analogy
      for how Bangladesh is navigating the impacts of climate change: with grit, ingenuity,
      limited technology and no safety net.\r\n\r\nI chose not to run photos of natural
      disasters and floods in this issue. Devastation is already well documented on
      rolling 24 hour news channels, but we hear less about Bangladeshis’ resilience
      in the face of encroaching seas and erratic rains. \r\n\r\nI also met those
      people for whom the only adaptation option was migration. This brought with
      it the danger of cross country border-crossings or the misery of destitution
      in bursting cities.\r\n\r\nAdaptation to climate change charts a path between
      ecology, climate science and competing models of development. The latter is
      the subject of both our Argument and special feature this month. \r\n\r\nOur
      debaters consider whether aid should be cut to countries with poor human rights
      records, while Andrew Bowman considers some of the downsides to Bill Gates’
      brand of ‘venture philanthropy’.\r\n\r\nWorldbeater returns this issue, taking
      aim at Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang: ‘ruthless kleptocrat and good family
      man’."

    editors_letter: ! "Like a lot of recent graduates, in my early 20s I lived briefly
      in a co-op house. It was a shaky experiment. The big social and political issues
      of the day were submerged in the daily grind. Dirty dishes were our downfall.\r\n\r\nSince
      then I’ve passed a major chunk of my life here at New Internationalist, a much
      more successful co-operative with a long track record. We’ve had our ups and
      downs but we’ve survived as a ‘worker co-op’ for almost three decades now. \r\n\r\nWe’re
      not alone. Globally, co-operatives are thriving, a fact celebrated by this year’s
      ‘International Year of the Co-operative’. In this time of economic chaos co-operatives
      may be the only game in town, a human (and humane) alternative to business-as-usual.\r\n\r\nHere
      at New Internationalist being a ‘worker co-op’ means we run the show ourselves.
      Simple? No, it’s tricky being your own boss – satisfying, yes, but also frustrating.
      Hard to put the blame on someone else when you’re in charge. \r\n\r\nNo doubt
      we come across as a group of earnest do-gooders ceaselessly thrashing out the
      best ways to save the world. But you’d be surprised at how little time we actually
      spend talking about the ‘big issues’. \r\n\r\nThese days a lot of our time (meetings,
      meetings, meetings) is spent managing the business, figuring out how to survive
      in tough economic times. But we’re also not above having long, intense discussions
      about life-altering decisions – like what colour to paint the doors.\r\n\r\nThis
      issue also looks at another kind of work fraught with contradictions: voluntourism.
      When our kids take off to spend a gap year in Malawi or Mongolia, are they just
      paying patrons like any other tourist?\r\n\r\nIn addition, Tam Hussein, a writer
      with deep roots in the Middle East, looks beyond the daily bloodshed in Syria
      to probe the long-simmering tensions between contending ethnic factions in that
      country. "

    editors_letter: ! "Journalism isn’t a bad profession. It can have its risks, dangers
      and limitations, depending on what you do and where you do it. But, by and large,
      it isn’t life-threatening.\r\nUnless, like Sandra Rodríguez, you live just on
      the Mexican side of the border with the United States.\r\n\r\nSandra works for
      <i>El Diario</i>, a newspaper in Ciudad Juárez. She investigates crime and corruption
      in a city torn apart by the ‘war on drugs’. This is a place where journalists
      are routinely murdered for just doing their job.\r\n\r\nThe courage and persistence
      of Sandra and other reporters, who have lost colleagues when death threats turned
      real, takes your breath away. It shows a commitment to freedom of speech, to
      talking truth to power, way beyond what most of us will ever be called upon
      to prove. Writing in this month’s issue of <strong>New Internationalist</strong>
      on legalizing drugs, Sandra startlingly evokes what it is like to live and report,
      day-by-day, in the cauldron of impunity. \r\n\r\nAnd while we are on the subject
      of journalism, why is it that some conflicts get saturation coverage, while
      others are ignored? Nick Harvey explores this in an article that delivers some
      uncomfortable home truths.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are pleased to welcome the wonderful
      North American writer Alice Walker to these pages. She turns a simple Q&A into
      a kind of poetry that encompasses dust motes, the Dalai Lama, Fidel Castro and
      the Universe.\r\n\r\nPS: Special thanks to Tony Jackson for his help and tireless
      lobbying on the drugs issue."

    editors_letter: ! "Hip-hop artist Logic once rapped: ‘I get down for my people,
      down for my people, down with the government until we’re all equal!’ When I
      looked into the eyes of Logic’s first baby daughter, born a few weeks back,
      it seemed like a long time since we sat down to write those lyrics. It was before
      the police pulled me out of my wheelchair on a demonstration, when Hosni Mubarak
      was still chilling, before the London riots.\r\n\r\nI struggle to imagine how
      the world must look through a baby’s eyes. But when I see them smile, I know
      that however much destruction we cause, the generations that follow will continue
      to struggle to make things better.This issue celebrates youth movements working
      to do exactly that. Far from being apathetic, young people are challenging an
      unjust world and have the idealism and energy to change things.\r\n\r\nIn this
      month’s <i>Big Story</i>, Farah Jassat challenges preconceptions, asking why
      certain schools of feminist thought are ignored by the mainstream media. Laurie
      Penny stokes up outrage with her lowdown on how youth in the West are shouldering
      the burden of a broken economic model.\r\n\r\nWe take a look at the techniques
      of the uncompromising Chilean student movement and listen to the frustrations
      of youth activists in occupied Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe cover image is by Andre
      Anderson, age 20, whom we found thanks to LIVE magazine (run by 15-24 year olds)
      in Brixton, London. It was the ἀrst-ever publication I wrote for, at the tender
      age of 15. \r\n\r\nInspired by LIVE’s principles of being written for young
      people, by young people, this month’s <i>Big Story</i> is written almost wholly
      by under 25s, with the exception of music makers Akala and Seun Kuti (both 28).
      The next generation will inherit the planet we reside in. Who better to lead
      the struggle?\r\n\r\nAlso this month, Australian journalist Ollie Milman writes
      of the disgraceful way his country treats child asylum-seekers; and regular
      contributor Stephanie Boyd visits Guatemala, where indigenous groups are leading
      the ἀght against Canada’s Goldcorp goldmining corporation."

    editors_letter: ! "Puberty is a strange affair. I spent a large part of mine at
      the foot of our record player transfixed by a voice.\r\n\r\nWhile working on
      this edition about healthcare and health inequality and how they are bound up
      with economic inequality, a verse from a song from that time, ‘All My Trials’,
      has been on repeat in my head. In Joan Baez’s doleful, piercing soprano, it
      goes: ‘If living were a thing that money could buy/ Then the rich would live
      and the poor would die...’\r\n\r\nSuch well-worn truths when put so simply appear
      little more than clichés. But inspect the complexities of the debates around
      the divided health of our divided world, and beneath all the intricacy there’s
      that bedrock of inequity that still needs breaking up.\r\n\r\nMy attention has
      been drawn many times by my British colleagues to what has been happening to
      the National Health Service (NHS) in their country. A service conceived in the
      spirit of providing reliable, free-at-the-point-of-delivery care to all is now
      suffering fragmentation and marketization. There’s even a new political party,
      the National Health Action party (<a href=\"http://nationalhealthaction.org.uk\">nationalhealthaction.org.uk</a>),
      with the impetus coming from healthcare professionals, launching this month
      to campaign for restoring the original principles of the NHS.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
      of party politics, in news that will be old hat by the time you read this, Hugo
      Chávez has been re-elected president in Venezuela (something that was accurately
      predicted on our website by Jody McIntyre, guest editor of last month’s edition).
      The country’s all-out effort to bring healthcare to marginalized communities,
      with members of those communities being trained up as medics, will continue.
      Here you will find an article about the country that pioneered this vision of
      care – Cuba.\r\n\r\nIn the name of equal opportunities coverage, our <i>Worldbeater</i>
      this month is about those heroes of the one per cent, the Koch brothers.\r\nAnd
      the suspense is killing us about what kind of showing the Booker-shortlisted
      author Jeet Thayil, who talks robustly about the work of writing in our interview,
      will make. That decision will happen, annoyingly for us, just as this edition
      goes to the printers."
